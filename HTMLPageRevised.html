	<h2>About Me</h2>
		Hello, and Welcome! As you probably noticed above, my name is Ryan Jasany.  
		Currently, I am a second year student at Tri-C.  
		I am pursuing an Associate's of Business in Programming and Development.
		Additionally, I am taking classes to receive the Mobile and Web Development certificates.
		I enjoy spending time with my friends, going to the metroparks, and spending time with my cats.
		This past summer, my lucky stars shined, and I was able to intern at MTD Products on the ECommerce team.
		Those stars shined again because I was able to stay on after the end of the summer.
		Web Development is something I love learning about.  I am excited to dig into this class.

<h2>Coffee Descriptions</h2>
<h3>What in the world did I just drink?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
Recently, I participated in a coffee tour around Portland, OR. While on the tour, I learned so much about how coffee was introduced to the US, how it is grown and roasted, and how it is brewed.
Parts of the cupping process, the way roasted coffee beans are evaluated, requires describing tastes and aromas. I thought it would be fun to list some of the descriptors used in the cupping process.

<div class="paragraph">On the left, is a picture of some drip coffee.  Drip coffee is brewed with ground coffee, a filter, and some hot water.
On the right is a Mocha.  This drink is made with espresso, steamed milk, and chocolate. You can top it with whipped cream if you would like!

<div class="paragraph">Above, you can see a guide to other drinks that baristas are well versed in!  Fun fact, the Americano was created when American soldiers couldn't get drip coffee in Europe.  The baristas would water down the espresso to create a more American drink.</div>
